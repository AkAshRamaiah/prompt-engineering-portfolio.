# Prompt Project 01: News Article Summarizer

## 🧩 Problem
I wanted to summarize a long news article into exactly 3 bullet points that are easy to understand.

## 💡 Final Prompt
"Summarize the following news article in exactly 3 bullet points with simple, clear language: [PASTE ARTICLE HERE]"

## 📄 Example Output
- The government has launched a new scheme to support small businesses.  
- The scheme offers tax benefits and easier loan access.  
- It will be available starting next month nationwide.

## 🛠️ Reasoning Behind the Prompt
I used bullet points to keep it concise and readable. I asked for “simple, clear language” to make sure anyone could understand it.

## 🔁 Iteration & Improvement
Earlier versions didn’t ask for clarity, so the language was too formal or complex. Adding the phrase "simple, clear language" improved the result.
