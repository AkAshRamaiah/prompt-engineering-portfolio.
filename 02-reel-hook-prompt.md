# Prompt Project 02: Reel Hook Generator for Small Indian Businesses

## 🧩 Problem
I wanted to help a digital marketing agency create 5 hook lines for Instagram reels, targeting small Indian businesses.

## 💡 Final Prompt
"Generate 5 Instagram reel hook lines for a digital marketing agency targeting small Indian businesses. Make them punchy, emotional, and under 15 words each."

## 📄 Example Output
- "Still running your business offline? Here's why that's costing you."  
- "Instagram isn't just for selfies—it's for selling!"  
- "Small budget? Big impact. Here's how."  
- "Your business deserves more than local word of mouth."  
- "Turn followers into loyal customers with this one trick."

## 🛠️ Reasoning Behind the Prompt
I added specifics like “punchy, emotional, under 15 words” to control the tone and length. Without that, the hooks were generic.

## 🔁 Iteration & Improvement
Initially, the prompt was vague and gave boring results. Adding a target audience and format type helped sharpen the quality.
